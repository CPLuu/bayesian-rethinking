    "    \"Python is the programming language of choice for many scientists to a large degree because it offers a great deal of power to analyze and model scientific data with relatively little overhead in terms of learning, installation or development time. It is a language you can pick up in a weekend, and use for the rest of one's life.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"The [Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) is a great place to start getting a feel for the language. To complement this material, I taught a [Python Short Course](http://www.wag.caltech.edu/home/rpm/python_course/) years ago to a group of computational chemists during a time that I was worried the field was moving too much in the direction of using canned software rather than developing one's own methods. I wanted to focus on what working scientists needed to be more productive: parsing output of other programs, building simple models, experimenting with object oriented programming, extending the language with C, and simple GUIs. \\n\",\n",

In the last year or so, the [IPython Project](http://ipython.org) has put together a notebook interface that I have found incredibly valuable.

In the interest of putting more notebooks out into the wild for other people to use and enjoy, I thought I would try to recreate some of what I was trying to get across in the original Python Short Course, updated by 15 years of Python, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, and IPython development, as well as my own experience in using Python almost every day of this time.\"\n",

This schizophrenia is largely intentional: when it became clear that some non-backwards-compatible changes to the language were necessary, the Python dev-team decided to go through a five-year (or so) transition, during which the new language features would be introduced and the old language was still actively maintained, to make such a transition as easy as possible.

It's a basis of Dirac Î´ functions at each point; we interpret the space betwen the points as being \\\"filled\\\" by the wave function, but the finite difference basis only has the solution being at the points themselves. We can fix this by dividing the eigenfunctions of our finite difference Hamiltonian by the square root of the spacing, and this gives properly normalized functions.\"\n",
